# rvn Baseline Benchmark

Generated: 2026-08-16T18:08:33.449Z
Repository: `main` @ `d6f3173c34f5d0bff9bdf94617125cb0974537dc`

## Scope

This is the Phase 00 synthetic baseline. It starts the built rvn application runtime, registers a temporary fixture workspace, measures the loopback MCP HTTP transport, and deletes the fixture afterward. It is a repeatable local contract baseline, not a production-machine benchmark.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Node | `v24.16.0` |
| Platform | `win32/x64` |
| Transport | loopback Streamable HTTP (legacy-compatible claim-less MCP route) at `127.0.0.1 (ephemeral port)` |
| Runs per scenario | 3 |
| Configured retries | 0 |
| Request timeout | 30000 ms |
| Fixture | temporary synthetic repository; deleted after the run |

## Measurement contract

- **Tool calls** count `tools/call` requests only. The handshake and discovery requests are reported separately and included in **protocol requests**.
- **Latency** is measured around each HTTP request from the benchmark process. Workflow latency covers all sequential tool calls in one scenario run.
- **Bytes transferred** is the UTF-8 request body plus the raw HTTP response body for every measured request, including the discovery handshake in the total.
- **Result bytes** is the raw response body for tool calls; it includes the JSON-RPC envelope and MCP result metadata.
- **Errors** count transport/JSON-RPC failures and MCP tool results with `isError: true`. A failed step does not discard sibling steps in the scenario.
- **Retries** count only automatic transport retries. The default baseline uses zero retries so failures remain visible.

## Baseline interpretation

This report records the current sequential call cost before Phase 01. Future parallel execution, context aggregation, pagination, indexing, and caching changes must preserve the primitive-tool contract and must be compared against this report without silently reducing accessible context.
