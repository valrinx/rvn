# rvn Phase 01 Compatibility Benchmark

Generated: 2026-08-16T18:19:46.017Z
Repository: `main` @ `3ba7d48da9eba432988414fb03322d1f33a84fca`

## Scope

This is a post-Phase-01 compatibility snapshot. It starts the built rvn application runtime, registers a temporary fixture workspace, measures the loopback MCP HTTP transport, and deletes the fixture afterward. It retains the Phase 00 sequential scenarios so tool-catalog and transport changes can be compared without replacing the original baseline.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Node | `v24.16.0` |
| Platform | `win32/x64` |
| Transport | loopback Streamable HTTP (legacy-compatible claim-less MCP route) at `127.0.0.1 (ephemeral port)` |
| Runs per scenario | 3 |
| Configured retries | 0 |
| Request timeout | 30000 ms |
| Fixture | temporary synthetic repository; deleted after the run |

| Retries | 0 |

## Measurement contract

- **Tool calls** count `tools/call` requests only. The handshake and discovery requests are reported separately and included in **protocol requests**.
- **Latency** is measured around each HTTP request from the benchmark process. Workflow latency covers all sequential tool calls in one scenario run.
- **Bytes transferred** is the UTF-8 request body plus the raw HTTP response body for every measured request, including the discovery handshake in the total.
- **Result bytes** is the raw response body for tool calls; it includes the JSON-RPC envelope and MCP result metadata.
- **Errors** count transport/JSON-RPC failures and MCP tool results with `isError: true`. A failed step does not discard sibling steps in the scenario.
- **Retries** count only automatic transport retries. The default baseline uses zero retries so failures remain visible.

## Baseline interpretation

This report records the sequential compatibility cost after adding `tool_batch`. The original Phase 00 report remains the comparison baseline; the new compound engine is covered by focused parallel, dependency, timeout, cancellation, partial-failure, and mutation-serialization tests.
